OHCI Host Controller Driver for MPC5200
=======================================

The OHCI HCD is written for the MPC5200 running with [deep](http://deepjava.org/). It will be integrated into the [deep runtime library](https://github.com/deepjava/runtime-library) later.

This Host Controller Driver is a minimal implementation and does not implement the whole OHCI capability. At the moment only Bulk and Control Transfers are supported, Interrupt and Isochronous Transfers will follow later.
